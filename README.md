Hello! I'm Kleeo.

I'm a Computer Science major at Universty of Illinois Chicago set to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in 2027. 
Currently on the look out for summer internships focusing on the low level coding and memory managment.

I adore computers, I always have. Growing up, I witnessed my father and a family friend, who worked in digital forensics, wiping some of my father’s old PCs to reuse after he changed jobs. They opted to use an older software called “Darik’s Boot and Nuke,” configured to the DoD setting type “long”: for seven sequential randomized overwrites. They explained to my younger self that when a file is deleted normally, it can still be reconstructed using magnets when written to magnetic media. I was transfixed–it set a learning path I still follow into computers and coding.

Languages: C, C++, Java, Python

Skills: Systems Programing, User Expirence, Design and Visuals
